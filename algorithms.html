 	<p><p style="text-indent: 50px">Algorithms can aid advertisers to find their target customers through gathering users' data including their browser history, what they tend to look at, what they like on social media, location etc. The algorithms take into account a lot of these data and calculate what this particular user will most likely buy upon seeing the advertisements. For instance, Target, a shopping website, had successfully ‘predicted’ a teenage girl’s pregnancy before her father even know through collaborative filtering, one of the methods the algorithm utilized to anticipate targeted customers’ preferences through collecting a huge amount of data on users’ behavior, online activities and preferences and examine the similarities among other users (Thorat, 2015). In Target’s case, they compared her recent shopping habits with other customers, reaching the ultimate conclusion of her pregnancy. With the new information in-store, the algorithm will start recommending pregnancy-related products or what items similar customers have bought such as prenatal vitamins and maternity clothing (Duhigg, 2012). As Thorat et al. (2015) mentioned, companies can add newly collected data easily into the algorithm by using the collaborative filtering approach, the algorithm will predict more accurately eventually since it is model-based. </p><br><br>

    Another way algorithm determines what to recommend or remove is through content-based filtering where it will record user’s digital behaviors such as their preferred genre, which political side they prefer reading etc. It guesses what do their consumers like by looking at the user’s preference model and interaction log with the recommender system, after determining what they want, the algorithm searches its database for compatible item attributes then recommends it to the user (Thorat et al., 2015). Well-known platforms like Netflix and YouTube work under such an algorithm, to tailor each user’s specific recommendation lists. As seen in Figure 3, Netflix utilizes these data and categorized them into various rows to accommodate users’ different tastes. They have used Personalised Video Ranking, Top-N Video Ranker, Trending Now Ranker, Continue Watching Ranker and Video-Video Similarity Ranker as the basis of their algorithm. Using Top-N Video Ranker as an example, it is evaluated and made by both metrics and algorithms to create a list of personalized and trending shows from different time windows for the viewer to choose from (Gomez-Uribe & Hunt, 2015).  Their recommendation system has aided Netflix to achieve 80% stream time and was praised by their consumers for their accuracy.</p></p>
